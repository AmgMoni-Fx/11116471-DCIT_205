      <h1>Cloning and Setup</h1>
      <p class="paragraph-spacing">
        clone" refers to the process of creating a local copy of a remote repository.
         When you clone a repository, you create an exact replica of the entire project, including all its files, commit history,
          branches, and tags.<br>
          Cloning a repository is an essential step when starting to work on a project collaboratively or when you want to have a local 
          copy of a project on your machine. By cloning a repository, you can have access to the project's source code and its full history,
           enabling you to make changes, contribute to the project, or work on it independently.
           </p>
           </div>

           <div class="clone">
           <h1 style="text-align: center;">This Steps can Help Cloning and Setup</h1>
           <li><h3>Clone the repository:</h3>  Use the git clone command followed by the repository URL to create a local copy of the project on your machine.</li>

           <li><h3>1. Navigate to the project directory:</h3>   Use the cd command to change your current directory to the project directory that was created after cloning.</li>
            
            <li><h3>2. Install dependencies:</h3>Install dependencies: Depending on the project, you may need to install the required dependencies. 
              This is typically done using a package manager such as npm (Node Package Manager) or yarn. Use the appropriate command 
              (npm install or yarn install) to install the project dependencies based on the project's package.json file.</li>
            
           <li><h3>3. Configure environment variables:</h3>  Some projects require configuration of environment variables for things like database connections,
             API keys, or other sensitive information. Check if the project has any specific environment variables that need to be set and provide the necessary values.</li>
            
           <li><h3>4. Start the development server:</h3>   Use the appropriate command (npm start or yarn start) to start the development server. 
            This command will compile the project's source code and start a local server that allows you to view the website in your web browser.</li>
            
            <li><h3>5. Access the website:</h3>  Open your preferred web browser and visit the specified localhost address (e.g., http://localhost:3000) to access the locally running website.</li>
